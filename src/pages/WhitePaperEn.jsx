			<h2>Introduction </h2>
			<p>
				Did you know that health services providers lose millions of pesos
				monthly? It is very common to see that the lack of knowledge about
				regulations of the health sector leads to processes being carried out
				incorrectly , so Glosess are made at the time of charging for the
				services provided. These glosses are objections to the billing
				presented, so many of these bills end up being negotiated at a loss for
				the ones who provided the service, due to errors in the billing or
				misdescription in the medical record. After living the same situation,
				the idea arises in 2015 to build a platform that helps the health sector
				to reduce this type of errors and thus NormasSalud.com is born, a
				platform where health institutions and anyone finds all the Colombian
				health standards in a single search engine. At NormasSalud.com you can
				find thousands of regulations since 1938 to the present, as this
				platform is updated daily with each regulation issued by the different
				control bodies. At Normassalud.com you also have access to tools that
				help to reduce process time and minimize money loss. We will talk about
				these tools later in this White Paper. With NormasSalud´s tools and
				content we have helped thousands of people to improve their processes,
				lowering the level of administrative gloss and account returns by up to
				80 or 90%, all of this supported by current regulations.
			</p>
			<h2>Legal warning</h2>
			<p>
				This White Paper is a document that allows us to show you all the
				benefits that you can obtain in normaSalud.com and to know what the
				platform is about, its tools and support, but it is not an investment
				recommendation. Since it is your responsibility to make the best
				investment decisions based on your own analysis and in-depth knowledge
				of the projects.
			</p>
			<h2> Description of the problem and Market </h2>
			<p>
				Imagine having your billing for services rendered and not being able to
				collect it! This happens a lot in the health sector and directly affects
				users because coverage is lost in the provision of services, there are
				even institutions that go bankrupt because of it. Why is this happening?
				There are several factors such as the misuse of resources, poor billing,
				poorly completed medical records, RIPS that do not pass validations and
				delay filing, among others. All of this also leads to objections
				(Glosses), returns of accounts and we can also add the non-timely
				payment of some insurers and others responsible for paying for the
				provision of health services. A bad result! After all these losses of
				money and delays in payments the health service provider suffers a lot
				due to lack of resources, which leads to delays in payments to officials
				such as doctors, nurses and administrative staff, non-payment to
				suppliers and also cut staff. All this is reflected in a poor provision
				of services to patients because they can no longer provide full coverage
				of care. A big problem that we have seen in most health institutions is
				that they have constant staff turnover, which means that outgoing
				officials leave with all the knowledge of each institution’s process,
				especially in the billing area. This is because in most cases the
				salaries of these billers are low and the officials end up looking for a
				better opportunity. In this case, the institution does not understand
				that a good work group and adequate training in the processes will allow
				it to provide better service, generate more income and minimize money
				losses. Another big problem in the health sector is that the standards
				issued by the control agencies are very changeable, and this means that
				the IPS, EAPB and independent professionals can make mistakes in their
				service provision processes and in the information reports. So, among so
				many regulations that come out almost daily it is difficult to know
				which of them should be applied by the institution according to the
				services it provides. Among the flaws that we have also detected is that
				the health sector loses millions of pesos for not having traceability of
				billing and total services provided. This is seen in alarming amounts in
				their contracting by capitation, PGP among others, due to the fact that
				all services are charged without carrying out a correct audit because of
				the lack of tools that facilitate these traceability processes. This
				causes repeated or unnecessary services to be provided, leading to the
				institution losing money. It should be noted that it is very difficult
				to detect these errors manually. Another imprtant issue the health
				sector suffers is the lack of Interoperability of clinical history and,
				What is this? It is simply the lack of connection between the clinical
				history registered by a provider in a medical consultation you attend
				recurrently and the one registered by another health service provider
				you attend for an eventuality. This means that the staff that treats you
				in other institutions, such as a specialist doctor, does not have access
				to your complete medical history. Unless you carry a complete portfolio
				of papers with all your history, which does not guarantee that the
				doctor will read them one by one. For this case of lack of
				interoperability in Colombia the Ministry of Health has taken a few
				small steps in terms of regulations and future guidelines. However, we
				must not forget the importance of data protection and transparency in
				the use of this information, where technology BlockChain can provide a
				great contribution. Educational content? Yes, one of the shortcomings in
				the sector is the difficulty in finding content such as courses where
				you can learn about those specific cases from day to day. Imagine an
				official suffering because he cannot find how to quickly make a report
				of the services provided in the last month of a health institution. That
				happens more frequently than you imagine, and the situation is
				aggravated when this report is suddenly requested due to events such as
				a meeting that has just started. Just as in this case, there are many in
				the internal processes of an institution, and the officials are fatigued
				by the workload and without the knowledge of certain processes or
				without digital tools that help them to lighten the tasks, so that the
				institution has better results. Homologating Codes for billing is a
				headache! What is homologation? In Colombia, health service provider
				institutions (IPS) and Benefit Plan Administrators make their health
				services contracting agreements based on tariff manuals such as the ISS
				2001 and SOAT and also create packages among other negotiations such as
				PGP, Capitation and by event. The SOAT Tariff Manual is based on DECREE
				2423 of 1996, which has its own coding list for procedures, and
				according to current regulations it is necessary that the procedures
				performed get billed with the codes of the Unique Classification of
				Procedures of Health (CUPS). Carrying out this crossing represents a
				headache for the institutions because the codes of decree 2423 have been
				fixed since 1996 and the CUPS have been changing according to the new
				procedures that are emerging and others that have been updated and
				divided with the pass the years This makes it necessary to have tools at
				hand that help facilitate the processes, as we have previously
				mentioned.

			<h3>Description of the product and how it will solve said problem.</h3>
			<p>
				Now you know some of the big problems that the health sector has. That
				is why NormasSalud.com was created for, a platform for knowledge
				management and tools to facilitate health processes and help avoid loss
				of money. Imagine having a billing group that is clear about the current
				regulations, knowing in depth the services offered by the institution,
				tariff manuals and with easy-to-use tools to facilitate the processes!
				This allows for fewer returns, glosses, dammed billing, and would
				clearly lead to the institution having more revenue and less loss. Here
				is everything you can achieve and find in NormasSalud.com
			</p>
			<h3> Surgeries Liquidator:</h3>
			<p>
				Liquidating a procedure that usually take hours can now be done in
				seconds with the NormasSalud Surgeries Liquidator. In many cases when
				surgical Services are provided, for example Orthopedics, and the billing
				or Quotes official needs to liquidate all the components that this
				procedure carries, can take even hours, depending on the experience of
				the oficial. That is why we created this great tool to settle the
				procedures automatically in seconds, where the official only has to add
				the CUPS code and the tool will calculate all the prices instantly,
				avoiding money losses and minimizing human errors that can be committed
				by lack of knowledge in health billing and rate manuals.
			</p>
			<h3> Standard Finder:</h3>
			<p>
				As mentioned before, health regulations are very changeable, that is why
				we leave at your disposal the Colombian health regulations since 1938,
				updated day by day in a single search engine to facilitate and speed up
				the search process.
			</p>
			<h3> Oxygen consumption liquidator: </h3>
			<p>
				When a patient spends a long time in hospitalization and in intermediate
				care and intensive care units the biller must add up and calculate the
				price of all those liters of oxygen, but be careful! This is done
				according to the quantities ordered by doctors, which can be very
				variable for each patient during that stay, for example; Today the
				patient is receiving 3 liters of oxygen per minute but tomorrow he may
				require a greater or lesser amount of it, according to the assessment
				and medical order. So that’s where the NormaSalud Oxygen Liquidator tool
				allows you to calculate the total according to that sum of liters. Jus
				imagine all the time that the biller can save and the errors that can be
				avoided with this tool, and thus the institution minimizes loss of
				money.
			</p>
			<h3> CUPS to SOAT Homologator:</h3>
			<p>
				Now the entire health sector have access to the only Homologator of SOAT
				codes of decree 2426 corresponding to medical, surgical and hospital
				procedures to CUPS Codes. This Homologator is a great help for providers
				of public, private, independent health services, insurers, among others.
				Best of all, it allows you to homologate the codes in seconds, so you
				can save time, minimize errors and lose money.
			</p>
			<h3>Digital Courses:</h3>
			<p>
				As already mentioned on this document, our goal is for the health sector
				to minimize money losses, save time in processes and reduce glosses and
				returns. That is why we create very practical digital courses such as
				RIPS (Individual Records of Provision of Health Services) course. Can
				you imagine being able to make a report of all services that an
				institution has provided, in minutes? For example, reports on the 10
				leading causes of patient consultation, drugs that were formulated the
				most, detailed billing and many other data that is relevant for the good
				management of a health institution. With NormasSalud RIPS Course you
				will learn step by step how to generate these reports in few minutes,
				which will give you an enormous advantage and great results for the
				institution.
			</p>
			<h3> Clinical History Software:</h3>
			<p>
				It is essential that the clinical history be digital since it allows
				traceability of patients`data and the control of the recorded data,
				therefore errors are minimized. It also allows correct billing according
				to the services provided, making it clear that the good completion of
				the clinical history is relevant. In accordance with the foregoing, at
				NormasSalud we have clinical history software that allows providers to
				record data on the reason for consultation, patient history, medical
				order and other required fields, in accordance with current regulations.
			</p>
			<h3> Patient Safety Software:</h3>
			<p>
				There are many cases of adverse events that occur to patients during
				their visit or stay in a health institution, for example patients who
				fall from a stretcher. According to current regulations, all these cases
				must be reported, initially an internal report is made and then it is
				directed to the different control agencies. However, in many cases these
				sitatuationes are not reported or are out of time due to the lack of
				patient safety tools that allow real-time communication. For this
				reason, at NormasSalud.com health institutions can find software
				exclusively for reporting adverse events in real time, allowing them to
				track how the event occurred and who reported it. In this way, the
				leader of the process will be able to have internal and direct
				communication on the software through messages with the people who
				report the events. All this and the fact of having identified the cases
				generates enormous benefits in the process and in the constant
				improvement in favor of the patients and the institution.
			</p>
			<h3> Consulting:</h3>
			<p>
				Learn to minimize money losses? Yes! Now Health service providers can
				count on the support of NormasSalud in their billing processes. Since,
				our goal is to provide personalized support, where the staff is shown
				the step by step to carry out a good load of services provided in the
				areas of Emergency, Surgery, Hospitalization, ICU, among others. In
				addition, they are also taught to properly bill all these services. Can
				you imagine having the support to learn how to bill correctly and thus
				generate more income and less losses? It is an excellent service that
				institutions should not afford to lose.
			</p>
			<h3> Play To Earn game with learning:</h3>
			<p>
				Blockchain and Health Sector Gaming? The world of Video Games with
				BlockChain is gaining strength and has been widely accepted in the
				Crypto market because it offers its users the opportunity to earn money
				while playing. There are several examples of successful cases such as
				Decentraland, Sand, among others. These games have generated thousands
				of dollars for their users. A clear example is that you could buy
				virtual land with the Decentraland currency (Mana) at a price of $400
				dollars and a few days ago those same lands were being sold at a price
				of 45,000 dollars, can you imagine obtaining that profitability? The
				time for the Health Sector to participate in BlockChain and Crypto Games
				has come. That is why our goal is to bring BlockChain technologies
				closer to the health sector through a Play To Earn game called “Health
				on Fire”. This is not a simple game! as it will also bring knowledge
				about diseases, among other topics. Imagine yourself learning about some
				diseases and their prevention while playing! That is what we are aiming
				for, as our goal is to bring health knowledge to people while they are
				making a profit playing. In this game people will be able to fight
				monsters, buy and sell characters, buy weapons and medicines for the
				character, among others. In return, they will get rewards in Tokens
				which they can exchange for other currencies such as BNB and then
				transfer it to their bank accounts, if they prefer to.
			</p>
			<h3> Support program for children with cancer.</h3>
			<p>
				In all these years of experience in the sector, we have found multiple
				cases of children from low-income families with cancer who face major
				problems, such as delays in carrying out consultations, diagnostic
				tests, among others, due to administrative procedures. This delays the
				start of timely cancer treatment in these children. Specialized
				consultations or private examinations are expensive and a family without
				resources will not be able to pay for these services in a private way.
				That forces them to wait until the authorizations are generated by the
				insurer and their availability. That is why at NormasSalud we have all
				the determination to help these children and we will do so by allocating
				a percentage of the token to this beautiful cause. With your support we
				will help to generate changes in the lives of many families who really
				need it. We will create alliances with insurers and health service
				providers to help streamline administrative procedures so that prompt
				service is provided to these children. Resources will be assigned to pay
				for specialized consultations and tests such as ultrasounds, among
				others, in cases where it is urgent for a diagnosis and it is not
				achieved through the payer. This will save many lives because many types
				of cancer progress due to delays in diagnostic tests. Ambulance
				transfers for children who have medical appointments or pending
				procedures and who do not feel well or it is difficult to take them on
				public transport, we will give all the support by paying the service to
				an allied provider. They will also receive food support when they have
				appointments outside of their hometown. It is very common to see that in
				the city where the patients live there are not certain specialties
				required for the treatment of children and they are transferred to
				another city. At that moment another great problem begins for these
				low-income families due to the need for lodging, food and cleaning
				supplies. For this purpose, funds will also be allocated and financial
				support will be provided in a controlled and organized manner.
				Psychological support and social work. These aspects are very important
				because families who have children with Cancer go through many emotional
				ups and downs and there is really very little support that we have seen
				in these areas. We will also support them by meeting their food needs
				because we really know many cases where, for example, the child does not
				have fruits, vegetables, among other supplements in their diet, since,
				as we have mentioned, they are low-income families. Recreational and
				artistic activities will be carried out. For this purpose,
				recreationists and other specialized people will be hired and thus
				ensure that these children and their families have amazing days,
				generating moments of happiness in the midst of all the suffering that
				patients with these pathologies and their families have. In cases of
				terminal cancer, children will be supported with care in their homes by
				doctors and nurses for palliative care. This will contribute to a better
				quality of life and minimize their suffering. NORS token will really
				bring a lot of blessings to these families, because with the allocated
				fund we will be able to change lives. Our commitment is to give a
				responsible administration to these resources and also to show you as
				investors the results.
			</p>
			<h2>Token: NORS </h2>
			<p>
				Nors is a utility token created on the Binance Smart Chain. It was
				issued with the purpose of allowing people to pay for content and
				digital tools focused on the health sector. Can you imagine connecting
				the entire health sector with BlockChain and Crypto technologies? We
				know many cases of officials from health institutions (doctors, nurses,
				billers, administrators) who want to invest or create projects in
				BlockChain and cryptos, but are afraid because they do not know much
				about the subject or have heard about people who have been scammed,
				since in this crypto world there many peopleho who take advantage to
				create scams. That is why we are excited to tell you that our goal is to
				work hard using our extensive knowledge and experience in health sector
				of 15 years working for health institutions and 6 years as a platform,
				in addition to the experiences lived in the crypto sector since 2017, to
				show through the token NORS that there are good, serious projects in
				which you can participate and obtain benefits. We are going to be
				carrying out this task in different scenarios such as events, social
				networks, subscribers, paid advertising, among others. In addition, let
				me tell you that NormasSalud has more than 13,000 followers on the
				LinkedIn network of professionals and more than 7,000 subscribers on its
				platform, who benefit from tools such as the CUPS to SOAT Homologator.
				That is why our focus is to create content that allows a greater
				adoption of BlockChain technology in the Health sector.
			</p>
			<h2> Tokenomics:</h2>
			<p>
				Thinking on the benefit of the entire community, only 69.103.201 tokens
				were issued and will be distributed as detailed below.

			<img src={Tokenomics} alt="Tokenomics" />
			<p>
				As you have seen on this document, the health sector requires digital
				tools that allow processes to be automated and NormasSalud is designing
				new tools for it. That is why 20% was allocated to strengthen the
				platform and thus facilitate processes for thousands of people of the
				health sector. In addition, our goal is for the community to get benefit
				of those tools. So, a percentage has been allocated for the development
				of the game and also to reward users who interact in the game.
